# Blockchain-Based Property Registration

This project implements a **secure, transparent, and decentralized property registration system** using **blockchain technology**. By leveraging blockchain's immutability and cryptographic security, the system ensures that property records are tamper-proof, reducing fraud and enhancing trust between buyers, sellers, and government authorities.

## Features

- **Decentralized Ledger** – Stores property records on a blockchain to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **Smart Contracts** – Automates property transactions and ensures compliance with predefined rules.
- **User Authentication** – Secure login and verification for buyers, sellers, and regulators.
- **Immutable Records** – Prevents data tampering, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Transaction History** – Maintains a complete record of ownership transfers.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum / Hyperledger Fabric
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Backend**: Node.js / Python with Flask or FastAPI
- **Database**: IPFS (for document storage) / PostgreSQL (if applicable)
- **Frontend**: React.js / Angular (if applicable)

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rojabugade//Blockchain-Based-Property-Registration.git
   cd Blockchain-Based-Property-Registration
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install  # For frontend and backend dependencies
   ```
3. Deploy the smart contracts:
   ```sh
   truffle migrate --network <network_name>
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   npm start  # or python app.py for backend
   ```
5. Access the system through the web interface and register property transactions securely.

## Future Enhancements
